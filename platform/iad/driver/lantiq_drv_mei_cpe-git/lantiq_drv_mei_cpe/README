HOW TO PREPARE COMPILATION
--------------------------

Provide your own LINUX build environment project setup:
- your own LINUX kernel include path
- number of VDSL2 devices (--with-max-device)
- number of DSL lines per VDSL2 device (--with-lines-per-device)


HOW TO COMPILE
--------------
execute the following commands on a shell in your build directory:

CONFIGURE for PPC:
------------------
$ <your package dir>/configure --build=i686-pc-linux --host=ppc_8xx\
							   --enable-kernelincl=/your/own/linux/include/path\
							   --enable-debug\
							   --with-max-device=1 --with-lines-per-device=1


CONFIGURE for MIPSEL (MIPS little endianess):
---------------------------------------------
- Provide the mipsel compiler flags (ADM5120)
	configure option: --enable-adm5120
- Provide your cross compiler prefix
	Example: mipsel-linux-
- Provide the path to the mipsel cross compiler tool chain.
	Example: /export/tools/bin

$ <your package dir>/configure --build=i586-pc-linux --host=mipsel-linux --enable-adm5120\
							   --enable-kernelincl=/your/own/linux/include/path\
							   --with-max-device=1 --with-lines-per-device=1 --enable-debug\
							   CC=/<your mipsel-crosscompile toolchain>/<coss-compile-prefix>gcc\
							   LD=/<your mipsel-crosscompile toolchain>/<coss-compile-prefix>ld\
							   RANLIB=/<your mipsel-crosscompile toolchain>/<coss-compile-prefix>ranlib\
							   STRIP=/<your mipsel-crosscompile toolchain>/<coss-compile-prefix>strip\
							   NM=/<your mipsel-crosscompile toolchain>/<coss-compile-prefix>nm\
							   AR=/<your mipsel-crosscompile toolchain>/<coss-compile-prefix>ar\
							   AS=/<your mipsel-crosscompile toolchain>/<coss-compile-prefix>as


BUILD the system:
-----------------
After configure the system (for PPC or mipsel), only type

make
