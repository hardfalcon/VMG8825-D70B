   \ref ifx_tapi_kclose to release a device handle that is not needed anymore.

   \remarks The client kernel module should check the function return value.
   A returned zero indicates that the resource allocation failed.

   \return Return the device handle in case the requested device is available.
   It returns \ref IFX_TAPI_KIO_FD_INVALID in case the device
   does not exist or is blocked by another application.
