   Read Command

   Read data from the device in a synchronous way. A read command is written
   using the command write routine. Then this code waits for response data
   to arrive in the cmd out mailbox, reads and returns it.

   The command write routine is used to write the read command. In this case,
   the protection against interupts and concurent tasks is done by Command Read
   routine itself. Refer to Command Write routine for more details about
   writing commands.

   \param  pDev         Pointer to the device structure.
   \param  pCmd         Pointer to the buffer with the command. It contains the
                        command header to be written.
   \param  pData        Pointer to a buffer for the result. It must be large
                        enough for the command header and the number of data
                        bytes to  read given in parameter nCount.
   \param  nCount       Number of data BYTES to read, without command header.
                        Must not be larger than the maximum mailbox size.

   \return
   - IFX_SUCCESS         on success.

                         sufficient or if low level function/macros fail.
   - VMMC_ERR_NO_FIBXMS  Not enough inbox space for writing command.
   - VMMC_ERR_OBXML_ZERO No data in the mailbox.

   \remarks
   Caution: nCount is in bytes now, not in words.
   \remarks
   Protection mechanism is done when the command is actually being written.
