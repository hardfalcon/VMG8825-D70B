/** \defgroup IFXOS_IF_THREAD Thread / Task.

   This Group contains the thread and task definitions and  
   function. 

\par IFXOS Thread / Task Concept

   The IFXOS thread / task interface hides the OS specific implementations. 
   Therefore the common OS independant user argument structure \ref IFXOS_ThreadParams_t
   is defined. 
   Furhter the user thread function must be from type \ref IFXOS_ThreadFunction_t.

   Thread / task create.\n
   Internal the thread create is wrapped to get an additional layer 
   for the IFXOS specific setup. 

   Therefore the thread create function allocates an internal OS specific data 
   structure and setup the given user informations.
   Then the thread will be created in a OS specific way with the 
   - internal OS specific data, and an
   - internal OS specific OS stub function.

   Within the internal IFXOS thread-stub function the IFXOS control setup
   is done before the user thread function is entered.
   - the run flag is set to "1"
   - the shutdown flag is set to "0"

   Thread / task delete.\n
   To terminate a thread / task the thread delete function will signal the 
   shutdown to the user thread function via the bShutDown flag within the 
   thread argument structure \ref IFXOS_ThreadFunction_t.
   This requires a cooperation of the user function and the IFXOS Thread control.

\note
   The OS specific data structures and also the OS specific stub function is 
   used only internal. So the user doesn't have to know anything about this handing.
