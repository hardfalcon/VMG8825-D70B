TPS65273 regulators
Dual synchronous step-down converter with i2c controlled vid and current sharing.
4.5-V to 18-V Wide Input Voltage Range. Output Voltage from 0.68 V to 1.95 V
with 10-mV Steps for Each Buck; Output Voltage can also be Set By Resistor
Divider.

Required properties:
- compatible: "ti,tps65273"
- reg: I2C slave address
- regulators: A node that houses a sub-node for each regulator within the
  device. The tps65273 is a dual-synchronous DC-DC so it will create two
  regulator devices on the system. Each sub-node is identified using the node's
  name, with valid values listed below. The content of each sub-node is defined
  by the standard binding for regulators; see regulator.txt.

Optional properties:
- vout_slew_rate: Programmable Slew Rate Control for Output Voltage.
- vout_psm_mode: Pulse Skipping Mode to achieve high efficiency in light load.
- regulator-always-on: boolean, regulator should never be disabled

Example:

	tps65273@62 {
		compatible = "ti,tps65273";
		reg = <0x62>;

		regulators {
			dcdc1 {
				regulator-name = "1V1VDD";
				regulator-always-on;
				vout_slew_rate = <0>;
				vout_psm_mode  = <0>;
			};
			dcdc2 {
				regulator-name = "1V5VDD";
				vout_slew_rate = <0>;
				vout_psm_mode  = <0>;
			};
		};
	};
