+
+These are modified version of the pon/poff/ip-up scripts contributed by Yann
+Dirson <dirson@debian.org>. They allow you to call "pon quick" respectively 
+"pon quick my-isp" to just call the provider for running you ip-up scripts in
+/etc/ppp/ip-up.d. This can be useful to check for incoming/flush outgoing    
+mail, without the necessary delay before hangup introduced by diald or such.
+
+These scripts break the possibility to connect to multiple ISPs at once, so
+they are included only here.
