User-visible changes in udns library.  Recent changes on top.

0.0.8 (12 Sep 2005)

 - added SRV records (rfc2782) parsing,
   thanks to Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo for implementation.

 - bugfixes:
   o use uninitialized value when no reply, library died with assertion:
     assert((status < 0 && result == 0) || (status >= 0 && result != 0)).
   o on some OSes, struct sockaddr_in has additional fields, so
     memcmp'ing two sockaddresses does not work.

 - rblcheck(.1)

0.0.7 (20 Apr 2005)

 - dnsget.1 manpage and several enhancements to dnsget.

 - allow nameserver names for -n option of dnsget.

 - API change: all dns_submit*() routines now does not expect
   last `now' argument, since requests aren't sent immediately
   anymore.

 - API change: different application timer callback mechanism.
   Udns now uses single per-context timer instead of per-query.

 - don't assume DNS replies only contain backward DN pointers,
   allow forward pointers too.  Change parsing API.

 - debianize

0.0.6 (08 Apr 2005)

 - use double sorted list for requests (sorted by deadline).
   This should significantly speed up timeout processing for
   large number of requests.

 - changed debugging interface, so it is finally useable
   (still not documented).

 - dnsget routine is now Officially Useable, and sometimes
   even more useable than `host' from BIND distribution
   (and sometimes not - dnsget does not have -C option
   and TCP mode)

 - Debian packaging in debian/ -- udns is now maintained as a
   native Debian package.

 - alot (and I really mean alot) of code cleanups all over.
