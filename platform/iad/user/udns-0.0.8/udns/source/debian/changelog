udns (0.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * don't compare sockaddr_in's, but individual parts only
    (on some OSes, there are additional fields in this structure
    so memcmp() does not quite work)

  * use dnsc_t instead of unsigned char for DNs everywhere

  * SRV records (rfc2782) parsing, thanks to
    Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo.

  * manpage fixes

udns (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * added dnsget.1 and rblcheck.1 manpages.

  * internal: use generic list implementation in udns_resolver.c

  * don't assume only backward DN pointers in replies, allow forward
    pointers too.  This is quite large change, involves changing
    parsing API all over the places.

  * internal: typedef dnsc_t and dnscc_t for [const] unsigned char, to
    make function prototypes shorter to better fit on a single line.

  * in parsing routines, verify (assert) that the query type
    is the one we can handle.

  * recognize names (and resolve them) as nameservers in dnsget.

  * when new request is submitted, don't send it immediately, but
    add it into the head of the active queue with deadline=0.
    This will allow us to tweak some query settings before it will
    be processed.
    Note API change: removed `now' argument from all dns_submit_*()
    routines.

  * use single per-context user timer, not per-query.
    Note API change: different user timer callback

  * add dnsc_salen field -- length of the socket address used

  * fix dns_set_opt(DNS_OPT_FLAGS) which didn't work before

  * allow to set some options for a context wich is open but with no
    active queries
